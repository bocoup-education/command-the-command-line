## About

Ken has long been getting by using graphical tools in his workflow. From Finder
to Scout, he's built a workflow that serves his needs pretty well. Things are
changing, though. As his team experiments with continuous deployment
strategies, his deliverables are being integrated into the product much more
immediately. He's been asked to submit changes using git, and even just
configuring the new tool has been a challenge (what is an SSH key, anyway?). He
knows this is a sign of things to come, but he doesn't know where to begin.
