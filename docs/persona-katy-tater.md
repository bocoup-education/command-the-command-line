## About

As seasoned JavaScript developer, Katy still remembers the excitement she felt
downloading jQuery 1.0. Since that time, her work has been built on
increasingly powerful tools. It wasn't until her company embraced Node.js that
she began to feel out-of-sorts, though. Her work on the server has exposed her
to an entirely different development environment, even though she works in OSX.
Debugging on a staging server felt like having the rug pulled out from under
her. She knows enough about the command line "to be dangerous," which causes
her some anxiety whenever she has to SSH somewhere.
