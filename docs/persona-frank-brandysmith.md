## About

Frank cut his teeth writing ASP and Java. He's no stranger to SSH, and he can
write a mean Bash script. That said, he knows he's out of his element when it
comes to managing systems. For instance, he's heard of `upstart`, but he's
never had to use it. He's signed up for *Learn Ansible*, though, so he figures
he'd better learn quick.
