# About the course

???

The goal of this course is to improve familiarity with Unix-like systems. Many
aspects of using Unix and its derivatives are non-obvious, and some are
downright confusing. We hope to help students understand the fundamentals so
that they can begin to feel more comfortable:

- working from a test-based command prompt
- using essential utility applications
- composing custom scripts to automate work and solve problems
- perform basic system administration tasks

Whenever possible, we try to explain the rationale behind the system design so
that students will not have to rely on rote memorization to build confidence.

In order to provide a consistent experience for all students across all
platforms, interactive exercises for this course are authored to be completed
within a "virtual machine." Thanks to the free and open source software
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/),
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/),
students can complete the exercise in a purpose-built Unix-like environment
using their personal computer and at no charge.
