Yar! There be treasure in these parts, and now's the time to grab it!

I see ya eyeing me wooden leg. You're right, I can't do this on me own. But
lest ye be gettin' any ideas about taking off with that treasure yourself,
remember I've got yer precious pet snail waiting in the galley. If I don't hear
word from you by midnight, I'll be feasting on escargot. Well it's just the one
animal, so not much of a feast, I suppose. It'll be mostly coconuts, like
always. Listen, what I'm trying to say is I'm going to eat your snail, okay? So
make it quick!

Follow the instructions in :chapter:vagrant: to get set up, then once you've
connected with `vagrant ssh`, you'll find a directory named `island` in your
"home" directory. Within that directory is a file named `turtle.txt`. Use `cat`
to read the contents and get your next step.
